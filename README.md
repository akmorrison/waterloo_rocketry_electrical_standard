## Purpose

This document is meant to be a collection of enforceable rules to be followed by any electrical project on the rocketry team. Anyone on the team is free to contribute to this standard. The main way this thing grows is by adding rules when we mess things up, so if you think you have a teachable moment, add it! If you think a rule is unnecessary or doesn't belong, bring that up, too. The point is to have a set of rules we can agree on and hold each other to.

## Contributing

Commits that fix typos, links, or other minor cosmetic details can be committed directly to master. Anything bigger, such as organization changes or adding/removing rules should be done on a separate branch. Submit a pull request to have it reviewed.

When you do submit your changes to master, please squash your commits (either with `git merge --squash` or `git rebase -i`) so that the git log for master remains coherent. Whether you squash your commits on your topic branch is up to you. If you're worried about losing review history after your patch has been submitted, just don't delete your branch after submission. Branches are cheap; whether you want to keep yours around after you submit is your choice.

Finally, don't forget to recompile the pdf before you submit! Latex can be downloaded for free [here](https://www.latex-project.org/get/). Alternatively, you can compile and download the pdf online using [latexbase](https://latexbase.com/) or similar.
